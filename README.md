### react-webpack-starter

This is a simple React / webpack / ES6 starter repository. Often I find myself needing more control over the config files abstracted by `create-react-app`, and wanted to learn how the insides of these build tools work, so created this starter. If you're just getting started with React / webpack, I'd highly encourage you to check out [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), instead of this.

## What this includes

* React 16
* webpack 3
* Babel
* ESLint
* `prettier`
* `eslint-config-prettier` to get ESLint and Prettier working nicely
* A `.eslintrc.js` config with some default rules, and paths where I store modules
* `jest`
